I am Professor of Quantitative Methods at the [University of Sussex](https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p9846-andy-field), UK. I’ve published a lot of research papers, blah blah blah, but no-one has ever read them, or would want to. The chances are if you're here it's because of one of my statistics textbooks and you don't need to be told that I write statistics textbooks, but I do.
